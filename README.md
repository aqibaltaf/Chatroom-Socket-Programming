# About
This chatroom application supports several clients and the limit for that can be easily hardcoded, the server acts as an intermediate and makes the communication between the multiple clients possible using threads. Concepts of Socket Programming are applied in this project and the messages and data are being send through socket streams thus TCP is used. Data structure concept such as linked list are also used for adding and deleting the clients. The chartroom works like a discord server and people can communicate easily through this server.
